This is a development branch for the html5_media module found on drupal.org: http://www.drupal.org/project/html5_media

The purpose of this repo is for troubleshooting and sharing. The main goal I want to accomplish is to add the ability to combine two audio files contained within the same field into one display to aid in cross-browser compatibility by modifying the hook_field_formatter function contained in the .module file.
